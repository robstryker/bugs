broken-progressbar
==================

Import into Eclipse

Try run `src/ShowProgress.java` (it has a main method)

Try click 'Show Progress' with and with the 'setTaskName()' option.

Without it the dialog runs through the 100 ticks instantly.

With setTaskName() OSX runs very slow, on Linux decently fast, on Windows super-fast.
